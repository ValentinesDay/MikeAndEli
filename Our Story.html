<div class="first_date">
  <p>first date<span class="date">june 15</span><br />
  <small>There once was a geeky boy & a slightly nerdy girl each searching for eachother, but never knowing it. One day they connected online & exchanged messages. The day came to meet and the slightly nerdy girl found herself walking into Bad Apple and meeting the geeky boy. They grab a table and talk (well mostly her). They talk about their families and siblings (0 for him & 6 for her), the jobs (software developer for him & recruiting for her) and hobbies (reading for both!) The date is going great and they move to another bar for more drinks and talking. The slightly nerdy girl realizes how late it has become and must leave. She makes a quick goodbye and hopes he'll text her again.</small></p>

<div class="Hawks">
  <p>Hawks Win!<span class="date">june 24</span><br />
  <small>The hawks win and are going into the last game of the series. The geeky boy and slightly nerdy girl make plans to watch the game at a bar. In the excitement of the championship win both feel the desire to kiss each other but the opportunity passes them by. The geeky boy escorts the slightly nerdy girl to a taxi --- next time they both say.</small></p>
</div>
<div class="Kiss">
  <p>Birthday & First Kiss<span class="date">june 28</span><br />
  <small>That following Friday (the geeky boy's birthday) they find themselves at a restaurant ordering a bottle of wine and eating delicious food. Afterwards they move to a loud bar where their mutual poor hearing forces them to sit closer and close. Every touch is electric! After confirmation that it is no longer his birthday (first kisses shouldn't very be confused with birthday kisses) they exit the bar to go for a night cap and kiss for the first time!</small></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="Fall">
  <p>Fall<span class="date">Fall</span><br />
  <small>Continues dinners and drinks and activities - picnics, music in the parks, street festivals, cheering on half marathon (and bringing much needed iced coffees), flowers, nerdy girls birthday celebrations, Lincoln Park Zoo lights, robot date night, nights watching breaking bad and Sundays (and many Mondays) filled with football (and one fantasy football champion) and cooking, meeting the family and friends, spending Thanksgiving out of town together, a hundred bets, a thousand laughs, a million text messages, and billion of kisses brings is to New Year's Eve.</small></p>
</div>

<div class="NYE">
  <p>New Years Eve 2014<span class="date">december 31</span><br />
  <small> After exchanging Christmas gifts (a wireless soul sensor from him and a thesaurus and Settlers Of Catan from her) the couple take in a quiet dinner at Francesca's and then set off to Emporium for midnight toasts of Malort. Down the snowy street they walked when the slightly nerdy girl slightly blurted out "I love you!"</small></p>
</div>
<div class="Valentines">
  <p>Valentine's Day 2014<span class="date">february 14</span><br />
  <small>A cold January starts off, but not for this couple! Dining out and cooking, building robots, meeting friends, going to parties, skiing in Canada (for one of them) and making future plans - oscar movie marathon, additions and subtraction a to the dinning list, caching in on bets, holidays always keep this couple warm and looking towards the future. So on this Valentine's Day, the slightly nerdy girl learns HTML and css to impress the geeky boy.</small></p>
